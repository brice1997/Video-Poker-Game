# Video-Poker-Game

Implementation of a simulation of a popular casino game usually
called video poker. The card deck contains 52 cards, 13 of each suit. At the beginning
of the game, the deck is shuffled. You need to devise a fair method for shuffling. (It
does not have to be efficient.) The player pays a token for each game. Then the top
five cards of the deck are presented to the player. The player can reject none, some,
or all of the cards. The rejected cards are replaced from the top of the deck. Now the
hand is scored. Your program should pronounce it to be one of the following:
• No pair—The lowest hand, containing five separate cards that do not match up
to create any of the hands below.
• One pair—Two cards of the same value, for example two queens. Payout: 1
• Two pairs—Two pairs, for example two queens and two 5’s. Payout: 2
• Three of a kind—Three cards of the same value, for example three queens.
Payout: 3
• Straight—Five cards with consecutive values, not necessarily of the same suit,
such as 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The ace can either precede a 2 or follow a king. Payout: 4
• Flush—Five cards, not necessarily in order, of the same suit. Payout: 5
• Full House—Three of a kind and a pair, for example three queens and two 5’s.
Payout: 6
• Four of a Kind—Four cards of the same value, such as four queens. Payout: 25
• Straight Flush—A straight and a flush: Five cards with consecutive values of
the same suit. Payout: 50
• Royal Flush—The best possible hand in poker. A 10, jack, queen, king, and ace,
all of the same suit. Payout: 250
